### Cubic Pattern

##Description 
A cube within a cube pattern. This is the original pattern I aimed to recreate for the wrapping pattern assignment.

##Functions 
Using a nested for() loop, a grid of cubes within cubes are created.
The cubes are created using beginShape(), vertex() and endShape() methods. The four vertices are for each corner of the cube. The points are hard coded

##Modulo
Modulo is a math operation which finds the remainder of a number divided by another number. Modulo is used to check if grid row is an even number. If 'j' is an even number, the cube's x position has a minus offset.

##Color 
The color for each face of the cube are stored in an array.
