### Exercise 08 - Original Pattern

A pattern of a cube within a cube.
Using a for loop, a grid of cubes within a cube is created.
The cubes are created using `beginShape(), vertex(), endShape()` functions. The four vertices are for each corner of the cube.
Using a modulo, if 'j' is an even number, the cube's x position has a minus offset.
