### Exercise 02 - Color wheel

Created a color wheel using `beginShape(TRIANGLE_FAN)`
- set a number of segments which is divided into 360 -- `stepAngle`
- `angleMode()` is set to DEGREES
- Inside the for loop, different points/vertex is created
- it loops through 360 and increments by the `stepAngle`
