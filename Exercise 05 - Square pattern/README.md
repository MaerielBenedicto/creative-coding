### Square Pattern

##Description 
Randomly generated square within a square in a grid that changes the size and strokeWeight of the squares. This uses the same methods as the 'line pattern' i.e. random()

##Functions
##Mapping and interactivity
The size of the squares are controlled by the x position of the mouse and is assigned to the variable r. The strokeWeight is controlled by the y position of the mouse and is assigned to the variable sw.

Using the random() method, a value of either 0 or 1 is generated. An if statement is used to check if the randomNum variable is 0 or 1.
If its 0, the squares is drawn with the r variable substracted from the width and height of the squares. If the randomNum value is 1, the squares is drawn with the r variable added to the width and height of the squares.

This created a many different outputs.
