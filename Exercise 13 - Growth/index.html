              <h2>Description</h2>
              <p>
                A circle at the center of the canvas with random other circles created at random points and is
                reposition to the circle closest to it.
              </p>

              <h4>Create the first point</h4>
              <p>
                A point object is created using the Point class. The point class has the x and y coordinates and
                diameter of the circle.
                The initial point in created in the <span class="span-code">initialPoint()</span> function.
                The color of the stroke is set randomly, x and y position is set to the center of the canvas.
                The point object is pushed into the points array. The <span class="span-code">render()</span> method
                draws the circle.
              </p>
              <h4>Create other points</h4>
              <p>
                The <span class="span-code">generateRandomPoints()</span> function is where new point is created. The x
                and y position and the diameter is set randomly.
                <br />
              </p>
              <br />
              <h4>Find the closest point</h4>
              <p>
                To find the closest point, the <span class="span-code">dist()</span> function is used. This calculates
                the distance between two points: the points in the array and the new point created.
                If the point has the lowest distance, that is set as the closest. Once the closest point is identified,
                the point is stored in the closestPoint variable.
                <br />
                The <span class="span-code">dock()</span> method of closest point is then called passing the new point
                as parameter.

              </p>
              <h4>dock()</h4>
              <p>
                The <span class="span-code">dock()</span> method accepts the new point object. This is set as the
                current point.
                The distances between the current point and closest point is calculated using the <span
                  class="span-code">p5.Vector.sub()</span>.
                This returns the resultant vector of the two points. To calculate the magnitude of the resultant vector,
                <span class="span-code">mag()</span> is used.
                To calculate the angle and direction <span class="span-code">atan2()</span> is used. The new x and y
                position is then updated by substracting the calculated distance from the current point position.
                The <span class="span-code">render()</span> method of the current point is then called with the new x
                and y position.

                <br />
                After docking the new point to its new position, the new point is then added to the points array.
              </p>

              <h4>Restart growth</h4>
              <p>
                If the points array reached the set max number of points, the canvas is cleared and the<span
                  class="span-code">initialPoint()</span> function is called.
              </p>

              <h4><br />Keyboard interactivity</h4>
              <p>
                <span class="span-code">keyPressed()</span> is added for keyboard interactivity.
                If user pressed 's' or 'S', the function <span class="span-code">saveCanvas()</span> saves the canvas as
                an image.
                The function <span class="span-code">gd.timestamp()</span> sets the name of the file as the date and
                time
                of when the image is saved.
                <br />
                If the user press the delete, the sketch restarts.
                <br />
