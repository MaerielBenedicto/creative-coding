# Rotating Circle pattern

##  Description
Grid of circles that rotates towards the mouse and changes its size depending where the mouse is.

## Functions
### atan()
The exercise uses the `atan2()` method and the `rotate()` method to rotate the circle towards where the mouse is.

### dist()
The `dist()` method calculates the distance between 2 points. This method calculates the distance between the mouse position and the translated co-ordinates of the circles. This value is assigned to the variable d. The size of the circle is mapped to the calculated distance value.
